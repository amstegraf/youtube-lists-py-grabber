# youtube-lists-py-grabber
Little python script to download your song list to a local file so that you can never lose your songs names again.
It also displays video id on the ones that became private, so that you can search them on google and recover the name of the song

I've lost a lot of favourite songs with youtube dropping them due to copyright or the videos becaming private so I thought
at least I should keep a list of song names. 

For me this script saves a couple of my lists once a month on my cloud service
